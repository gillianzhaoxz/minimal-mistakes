Hi! 

I'm Gillian, 35% learner, 35% analyst, and 30% design enthusiast. 

I am fascinated by the development of the urban environment and dedicated to promoting vibrant and sustainable communities with Smart Cities initiatives. Currently I am a student studying Urban Planning, building my skillset and knowledge in Informatics, Spatial Analysis, and Smart Economy. 

I hope to record my journey and share my interests via this website. I designed the logo to represent my Chinese name - "snow" and "bamboo". They signify nourishment and growth. They are also an isometric illustration to represent my interest in the spatial world.

欢迎来到我的网站。我是个爱好思考、分析、和设计的人。我喜欢研究城市发展，想要促进有活力、可持续发展的智慧城市。现在作为一名学生，我在学习信息学、空间分析和智慧经济相关的技能和知识。

我希望通过这个网站来享我所想，记我所学。我设计的logo代表了我的名字，雪和竹，象征着滋养和成长。它的等距投影也象征着我的在空间方面的领域。
