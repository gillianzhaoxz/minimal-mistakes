Hi! 

My name is Xuezhu but I go by Gillian too. The meaning of my Chinese name is 'snow' and 'bamboo'. In Chinese culture, 'snow' could be interpreted as nourishing and 'bamboo' signifies virtue and growth. My friends say my name is a great fit for my personality.

I spent 18 years of my life in Beijing, China before I came to the U.S. to study Urban Planning. Currently I am a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania. I enjoy studying Urban Planning very much and I am dedicated to promoting vibrant and sustainable communities with Smart Cities initiatives.

Besides Urban Planning, I am also interested in Informatics, Real Estate and Psychology. In my free time, I enjoy good food, music, and arts. I have played the piano for years and joined a school choir in the past.
