From this semester-long Introduction to Data Science course, I learned Python and using Python to analyze data. Through daily practice with programming exercises and data science projects, I developed core skills including:
+ Data science pipeline:
  + Data management (acquiring, cleaning, reshaping, organizing, persisting);
  + Data modeling;
  + Analyzing;
+ Python and programming topics:
  + Algorithm development;
  + Coding practices;
  + Data formats;
  + Reading and writing data resources;
  + Using regular expressions;
  + Various Python topics;
+ Data science topics:
  + Statistical inference;
  + Text processing;
  + Python modules (libraries) for NLP, statistics, mathematics, and data visualizations:
    + matplotlib, pandas, spaCy, NumPy, jupyter, Google Colab

I am looking forward to apply what I've learned from this class to planning projects.
